# discord-links-bot

A discord bot for replacing/trimming common links with more appropriate versions

## Supported links
- twitter links are replaced with fxtwitter links (bot hides original message's embed)
- media.discordapp.net links are replaced with cdn.discordapp.com (bot does nothing to the original message, for now)
